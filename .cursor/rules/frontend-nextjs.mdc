# Frontend Development Rules

## Component Architecture
- Functional components with hooks only
- Keep components focused (single responsibility)
- Extract complex logic into custom hooks
- Separate container (smart) from presentation (dumb) components

## State Management
- Use {state management approach}
- Keep state close to where it's used
- Lift state only when necessary for sharing

## API Integration
- All API calls through centralized client
- Handle loading, error, and success states
- Use {data fetching library if applicable}

## Dependencies
- Always use yarn as the package manager

## Styling
- Use Tailwind
- Follow design system tokens
- Ensure responsive design for all components
